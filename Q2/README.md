Question 2 Analysis

Signature

This section contains my analysis of Question 2 (Class Design):

My initial approach during the exam:

write down what the problem was asking for as a sentence,EX: if first letter is empty then..

My revised solution after review:

Key concepts tested in this question:

keeping up with ifs, where to put them and why.

What I learned from revisiting this problem:

It's important to write down your thoughts, especially problems using a lot of ifs and elses
