Question 3 Analysis
Competition/Competitor
This section contains my analysis of Question 3 (Arrays and ArrayLists):

My initial approach during the exam:

Write out the scenario and how the methods work on paper.

My revised solution after review:
*I forgot to write new in some lines of code*
Key concepts tested in this question:

ArrayList syntax and problem solving skills + loops

What I learned from revisiting this problem:

Don't rush and double check to make sure you dont forget syntax
